While I do not have much of an issue with this, I think it can be better streamlined if only the <code>public</code> folder get uploaded to Github.</p>
<p>Too happy with having hexth.com working, I was a bit hesitant to mess with it too much and decided to create a Github Project page instead. I started with a new repo on Github named <code>cv</code>. The site itself was created with Hugo locally. Instead of initialising git for the whole site folder, I initiated git only in the <code>public</code> folder this time and then set up Hugo as usual.</p>
<p>Once set up, I tried pushing the local repo onto Github but failed. Turns out there&rsquo;s no local <code>main</code> branch on the local repo nor the remote repo. So I created it using <code>git checkout -b main</code> before pushing the local repo onto Github. Got the whole thing working now and the test site is accessible at <a href="https://hexth.com/cv">hexth.com/cv</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also created a new bash script to run Hugo to re-compile the site after an update and automatically push the update to Github.</p>
