<p>I&rsquo;ve recently acquired <code>hexth.com</code> after its registration expired and decided to keep it together with <code>hexth.net</code> for the time being. I then set up <code>hexth.com</code> for this page and encountered a few difficulties; Github cant resolve the new domain properly until I did my domain verification, this issue resolved itself once domain verification was completed and https enforced.</p>
<p>So now I have a blog, with custom domain, and https enabled, generated by Hugo. Quite a success I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Next thing I need to tackle is to make sure <code>www.hexth.com</code> resolve to <code>hexth.com</code> as it seems like it&rsquo;s not working at the moment.</p>
